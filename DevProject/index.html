    <h2><strong>My learning to code journey!</strong></h2>
    <p>I will be learning to code with a few things i have learned:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to structure a HTML doc</li>
        <li>How to add CSS to a web page</li>
        <li>How to add images to a web page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is learning to code easy?</h2>
    <p>Throughout my journey i have struggled with certain elements. First learning HTML seemed pretty easy i was confident in what i was doing, but i never realised how much there was to learn about coding i have overcome obsticles and spent a while staring at the screen wondering where i have went wrong and how can i correct my errors?</p>
    <p>Learning to code is so much fun and im loving every part of my training even the parts when i am not sure what to do because, Once i have figured out the correct code to use i find myself feeling proud that i acomplished something i never thought i could do</p>
    <p><strong>If learning to code is something you are interested in i strongly recommend trying it for yourself you will not be disappointed!</strong></p>
